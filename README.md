# Stock Analysis
*Overview of Project*

The purpose of this project is to analyze stock data, by ticker symbol, between years 2017 and 2018.  The analysis will be done using VBA macros by refractoring the script and have it run more efficiently.  The final output will be a table compiling data for years 2017 and 2018.

*Results*

In 2017, all stocks, with the exception of TERP, performed well with positive returns.  The marco script ran at 0.5585938 seconds.  The original script ran at 0.078125 seconds but rendered no data in the table.  

In 2018, all stocks, with the exception of ENPH and RUN, had negative returns.  The macro script ran at 0.5625 seconds.  The original script ran 0.046875 seconds but with no data in the table.

*Summary*

Advantages of refractoring code includes finding bugs, making programs run faster, and making it easier to understand the code, etc. Code smell slows down the development and is prone to more defects. 

There are several pros and cons of refractoring the original VBA script.  Pros include enhancements, detection of code smell, bug fixing, and peer review. Cons are that refractoring the code can introduce bugs into the VBA marco, especially if there is a time crunch and you cannot test the code and the cost of refractoring can be higher than writing code from scratch.
